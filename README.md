# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project shows my messaging website called flack. It allows the user to sign in with a user name, create channels and send messages on these channels. Any activivity is updated in real time to the other users. My personal touch was to add a list of the actvie users on each channel at a given time. Whenever a user leaves or joins a chat this list is updated for all users in realtime.
